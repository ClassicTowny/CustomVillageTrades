# Custom Village Trades

CustomVillageTrades is a plugin for Minecraft servers running Spigot. 
It changes how villagers make their trade lists, meaning you can make them trade whatever you like. Whether that means 
seeds for spawn eggs, a more expensive diamond, or no trades at all is entirely your choice.
